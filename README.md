The files located in this repository are from previous work using 
esp32/micropython stepper motor control for the compliance 
project. It is not expected to use these files in total, but 
some of the code will be cut and pasted into the compliance
project's axis controllers found in compliance_be_[xyzt]_axis.

Think of this as an archive that I do not want to lose for a 
while.
